## About Me.

Irish software developer from Ireland. I explain with words and code. Former head of frontend at VSWare LTD. Passionate about JavaScript, React, Functional Programming and all things maths. I offer freelance work building websites for all types of clients, though my specialty is in e-commerce and SEO.

If you want a small business website, a online portfolio, an IOS/Android App or anything bigger, give me a shout.

I price my work depending on each client to ensure the best quote possible for you and your project.
