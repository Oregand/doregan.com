## Intro

So, it's been a while huh? I know, I know. You gotta understand though, it's been a weird couple of years. Has it been weird for you too? If it has that's okay.

Todays topic isn't software related so if you're looking for a breakdown of React hooks, server side rendering performance or event driven paradigms you're square out of luck. Todays topic is about finding the values that define your life, it's meaning and the legacy you might leave behind you one day.

### Values

What are values?

> Values are the answer to the question: “In a world where you could choose to have your life be about something, what would you choose?” (Wilson & Murrell, 2004, 135).

I think some people have a inherent, automatic understanding of their values. For some people they sit deep in their sub-conscious and these act in such a way where they're always in line with their values without needing to think about it. I am not one of these people. I often find I struggle internally because I often don't act in a way that aligns with my values.

Why though?

Well, in my very specific case I tend to fall back into learnt behavior's such as being passive and highly agreeable. While there is nothing inherently wrong with being agreeable or passive in life, for **me** it's wrong because it doesn't align me with my core values.

Maybe I hear you ask what are my values? After some reflection about what my own brief existence might mean to me I settled on the following 5:

1. Determination
2. Empathy
3. Fearless
4. Gratitude
5. Sexuality

### The Imposter At My Door

Why is it that sometimes we feel **wrong**? We feel, out of place, unsettled, or off? In my limited experience it's because we are living out of sync with our values and authentic self. What's most funny about this is that we are usually aware of this, we have a nagging suspicion of how we **should** act to follow our values and be authentic. Somewhere deep down, way down in our heart we already know what we need to do but we don't for various reasons, usually fear.

### Being Authentic

> "What is your life? It is just a vapor, appearing for a little while, and then vanishing." - James 4:14

Life is so short, so so very short. It's hard to try and explain to myself just how quickly life passes you by. If you want to life a meaningful life, you need to live authentically with your values. Every day the bank of time opens a new account for you and for me, 86400 seconds for us to use as we see fit. It allows no balances or overdrafts, fail to use the time and the loss is yours.

One day will eventually be my last and I want to be able to look back and say that no matter what, I made the choice to live authentically and not be afraid of the cost, because the cost of not living authentically is much higher.
