## Intro

Ive often found that through my career as a software developer(and life in general), I come across quotes that just stick. 

For whatever reason, they reach out and touch a part of you that can't help but understand the ideal behind it. 

So, peel back to UXUD 2017, Dublin. I attended with my company at the time, eager to soak up some amazing insights from people I admired.

The talk I was most excited to see? Honestly, I dont remember. 

What I do remember is sitting down to Skyscanner's chief technology officer Bryan Dove talk on his hiring policy. As I sat there finding general interest in the topic, he suddenly turned the focus to an development method he believed in and looked for in people he hired:

> Speed Of Iteration Beats Quality Of Iteration

This, is something Ive since come to understand as a driving force behind some of the best developers and creators Ive ever met. 

## Why This Makes Sense

_I would like to offer that I am a rather big picture type of human. And so this method appeals to that side of me, and while I live this ideal i understand the shortcomings of attention to details. Which is something I work on a lot myself._

### Software In Terms Of Risk 

Software is in the grand scheme of things quite low risk depending on the area you work in. If you work in hospital software or something similar, this post is not for you but the majority of software such as e-com? Not very high risk at all. 

### Fumble && Recover

To take another quote from a far more likely source: 

> Why do we fall? So that we can learn tp pick ourselves up.

The only real way to learn in anything, including software is to make mistakes. Mistakes are in fact, fine, despite what people might try to convince you. All of the sock star devs Ive ever met in my life not only fearlessly ran towards mistakes, they encouraged others to do so.

The most common argument against this is: "customer wont appreciate you making mistakes on their time.", and in my experience Ive two things to say about this:

1. DONT RUN TOWARDS MISTAKES DURING FRAGILE TIMES. Timing saves you a lot of stress.
2. The majority of managers, customers and co-workers are very quick to forgive mistakes that you make right. With this methodology you need to be okay owning your fuck ups and working to correct them, aggressively.    

### Good && Done > Perfect 

Bryan from Skycanner kept hammering the point in his talk that customers always come first, not devs. This is something I agree with. In the end, our job is to create amazing things that people _use_ and find _useful_.

Good and done is always better than perfect and never deployed. And if you lean into the ideal of small, frequent releases, you'll hit this mark on the head.  

## Conclusion

Speed, it beats quality almost every time. Try it in your next project and see how much you learn.
